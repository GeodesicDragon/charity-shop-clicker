* Added clothing department, with a starting price of £25,000.
* Added 'Designer Labels' upgrade, which increases the output of the clothing department by 10% each time it is purchased.
* Removed events, as they ended up causing calculation issues with your money per second. I will try to figure out a replacement in due course.
* Fixed some figures not being saved correctly.
* Fixed some figures not being loaded correctly.
* Fixed incorrect tooltip on the 'Good Plates' upgrade.
* Fixed incorrect tooltip on the 'Latest Releases' upgrade.

Version 0.6.13-Alpha (January 25th 2025)

* Added events.
	* Events have a 10% chance of occurring every ten minutes, and are chosen at random.
	* The possible events are:
		* PR Success: +50% money per second for 5 seconds.
		* PR Disaster: -50% money per second for 5 seconds.
		* Ringing Registers: +75% money per second for 10 seconds.
		* Sticky Fingers: -75% money per second for 10 seconds.
	* Once the event ends, your money per second is restored to its pre-event value.
	* Any departments or upgrades bought during the event will be taken into account, so no progress will be lost.
* Fixed the update checker incorrectly informing you of new versions when there weren't any.
* Removed tooltips from department buttons; they now show how much money per second they bring in.
* Fixed the 'Good Plates' upgrade not working as intended (I forgot to actually code it).
* Fixed the Latest Releases upgrade not working as intended (again, I forgot to code it).
* Fixed the Latest Releases upgrade showing an incorrect tooltip.
* Increased the bonus given by the Good Plates upgrade to 10% (was 1%).
* Increased the bonus given by the Latest Releases upgrade to 10% (was 1%).

Version 0.5.6-Alpha (January 21st 2025)

* Added automatic update checking on game start. If a new version is available, you will be given the option of visiting the GitHub page.
* Added a new department.
	* Home Media: Has a starting price of £10,000 and adds £20 per second.
* Added two new upgrades.
	* The Good Plates: Has a starting price of £100 and increases output of bric-a-brac by 1% each time it is purchased.
	* Latest Releases: Has a starting price of £500 and increases output of home media by 1% each time it is purchased.
* Added an autosave feature (works every five minutes).
* Game data is now saved to an XML file. The previous save method was clunky as hell, and saved data to a folder which used the current version of the game as its name, meaning that new versions would render old saves inaccessible. This should now be fixed, but you will need to start a new game.
* Reduced how much departments increased in price by when purchased to 10% (was 50%).
* Reduced how much upgrades increased in price by when purchased to 25% (was 50%).
* Removed border from the Available Money, Money Per Second, and Money Per Click boxes.
* Messages in the status bar are now cleared after five seconds.

Version 0.0.1-Alpha (January 1st 2025)
